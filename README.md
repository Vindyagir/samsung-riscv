<summary> Task 1:Spike Simulation  </summary>
<br>
-Spike is a RISC-V architecture simulator that allows for the simulation of RISC-V programs and software stacks.

-The objective is to execute the `fact.c` code using both the `GCC compiler` and the `RISC-V  compiler
, ensuring that both produce identical outputs in the terminal. To compile the code with the GCC compiler, use the following command
